               activity of the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens,
               constitutes a potential benefit, especially for low and
               middle-income countries. Besides waste reduction and
               stabilisation, the product in form of the last larval stage, the
               so-called prepupae, offers a valuable additive in animal feed,
               opening new economic niches for small entrepreneurs in
               developing countries. We have therefore evaluated the
               feasibility of the black soldier fly larvae to digest and
               degrade mixed municipal organic waste in a medium-scale field
               experiment in Costa Rica, and explored the benefits and
               limitations of this technology. We achieved an average prepupae
               production of 252 g/m2/day (wet weight) under favourable
               conditions. Waste reduction ranged from 65.5 to 78.9\% depending
               on the daily amount of waste added to the experimental unit and
               presence/absence of a drainage system. Three factors strongly
               influenced larval yield and waste reduction capacity: (1) high
               larval mortality due to elevated zinc concentrations in the
               waste material and anaerobic conditions in the experimental
               trays; (2) lack of fertile eggs due to zinc poisoning, and (3)
               limited access to food from stagnating liquid in the
               experimental trays. This study confirmed the great potential of
               this fly as a waste manager in low and middle-income countries,
               but also identified knowledge gaps pertaining to biological
               larvae requirements (egg hatching rate, moisture tolerance, …)
               and process design (drainage, rearing facilities, …) to be
               tackled in future research.",

  abstract = "The central limit problem is considered for a simple regression,
              where the residuals, x(n), are stationary and the sequence
              regressed on y(N)(n), may depend on the number of observations,
              N, to hand. Two situations are considered, one where the residual
              is generated by a linear process (i.e. the best linear predictor
              is the best predictor) and the more general situation where that
              is not so. Two types of conditions are needed, the first of which
              limits the contribution of any individual y(N)(n) and the second
              of which relates to the mixing properties of x(n). If
              $\epsilon$(n) is the linear innovation sequence, in the linear
              case, with limk$\rightarrow$$\infty$ E($\epsilon$(n)2∥Fn−k)=F2,
              Fn being the associated family of o-algebra, then the central
              limit theorem holds under minimal conditions on y(N)(n). Under
              sligthly stronger conditions on y(N)(n) and for x(n) weakly
              mixing this theorem and associated theorems, are shown to hold

  author    = "Cleveland, William S and Devlin, Susan J",
  abstract  = "[Most monthly time series that represent a total of some
               variable for each month contain calendar effects due to changing
               month length, day-of-the-week effects, and holidays. It is
               important to remove the calendar variation to allow an effective
               assessment of the variation due to important factors. New
               procedures for calendar adjustment are presented in this
               article. A plausible model for the daily data is used to derive
               a model for the monthly data in which the power transformed,
               month-length corrected data are equal to trend plus seasonal
               plus calendar plus irregular. The procedure for fitting the
               calendar component in the monthly model is (a) divide the
               aggregated monthly data by month length and multiply by 30.4375,
               the average month length; (b) choose a power transformation; (c)
               remove trend and seasonal components; (d) estimate the calendar
               parameters by robust regression. Since the model is only a
               hypothesis it is important to check its validity. This can be
               done by various residual plots in the regression analysis and by
               using spectrum analysis and time-domain graphical methods to
               detect residual calendar effects in the adjusted series. This

  author   = "Bollen, Kenneth A and Jackman, Robert W",
  abstract = "Gauging the robustness of regression estimates is especially
              important in small-sample analyses. Here, we examine recent
              developments in the detection and analysis of outliers and
              influential cases in multivariate studies. Specifically, we
              review five diagnostic procedures: partial regression plots, the
              ``hat'' matrix, studentized residuals, DFITSi, and DFBETASij. The
              main part of the article presents two empirical applications
              (drawn from recent cross-national studies) that show (a) how the
              diagnostic procedures can be incorporated into the research
              process, and (b) what we can learn from them. These applications
              serve to underscore the point that the diagnostics cannot be
              employed mechanically. Instead, once a case is diagnosed as
              influential, remedial action requires a firm substantive
              grounding. Although case deletion may be warranted in some
              circumstances, it is an extreme remedy of last resort that should
              not be routinely followed. The more fruitful approach is to ask
              why a given case is influential. As our applications indicate,
              the diagnostics can be helpful in isolating such problems as
              sample composition, specification error, and errors in
              measurement.",

  abstract = "To derive new methods for converting food and green wastes into
              soil amendment, this study researched on a in-vessel composting
              system. The performance of an in-vessel composting system was
              evaluated during food and green wastes digestion. A series of
              experiments was conducted using both pilot-scale and bench-scale
              in-vessel systems. During the digestion process, external heat
              and continuous mixing were provided for achieving the typical
              composting temperature of 60 °C. The feedstock included food
              waste, horse manure, palm-tree waste, and green waste. The
              digestate was tested for understanding the inactivation of
              pathogens (Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella enterica
              serovar Typhimurium LT2 (Salmonella)). Subsequently, pathogen
              inactivation models were developed to determine the quantitative
              time-dependent relationships between digestion time and potential
              pathogen cells in digestate. The digestate was also analyzed for
              evaluating the changes in pH, moisture level, variations in
              carbon content, and carbon to nitrogen ratio during the digestion
              process. Further, the effects of additives on the digestion
              process and digestate were evaluated by comparing the digestate
              quality under additive and without additives conditions. Results
              showed that the proposed method produced a pathogen-free soil
              amendment from the food and green wastes. The pH and moisture
              content of the digestate of pilot-scale experiment varied from
              3.8 to 4 and 60.6--67.9\%, respectively. The observations showed
              that E. coli survived greater than 10 h, while Salmonella counts
              were not detectable beyond 40 min of digestion. The results of
              predictive models showed that Salmonella could survive till 80
              min during in-vessel composting at 60 °C, while the elimination
              of E. coli may take 16--25 h. The authors anticipate that the
              in-vessel digestion system, which is proposed here, will help in
              accelerating the conversion of organic waste into pathogen-free
              soil amendment, thereby, enhancing sustainable agriculture.",

  abstract  = "Experimental design represents the typical context in which the
               interplay between Bayesian and frequentist methodology is
               natural and useful. Before the data are observed, it is licit
               and unavoidable even for a Bayesian statistician to take into
               account sample variability for the evaluation of statistical
               procedures and for decision making. At the same time, design
               planning fatally involves a number of pre-experimental choices
               that even a frequentist statistician is forced to make,
               preferably by exploiting external sources of knowledge. In this
               paper we discuss this mutual exchange between Bayesian and
               frequentist methodology, with specific focus on the primary
               crucial aspect of experimental designs, that is sample size
               determination (SSD). We review this topic by highlighting how
               the interplay between two prior distributions helps in managing
               the close relationship between the two approaches. Although the
               distinction between decisional and performance-based methods for
               Bayesian SSD is discussed, the main interest of this article is
               on the latter. We propose a general framework that includes
               several performance-based methods as special cases and thus
               makes the comparison of their characteristics easier. Finally,
               we extend the overview to robust methods for Bayesian SSD that
               allow to deal with the critical issue of sensitivity to prior
               elicitation. Illustrative examples are provided for normal

              involved 28 cases across dominant retail store formats (i.e.,
              super- and hypermarkets and discount and convenience stores). The
              results along with secondary data research underlie a process

              implications of our research and the related solutions. Our
              ﬁndings show that the root causes of food waste are related to
              undesirable customer behavior and erratic demand, inefﬁcient

              of municipal actors in pushing the issue forward has been
              comparatively limited. Based on the cases of the German cities of

              to prevent food waste at the municipal level and their relevance

  abstract = "Research on on food waste is often reductionist, in that it
              attempts to measure food waste at single points within the supply

              wasted within the supply chain, it does not necessarily answer
              why and how food is wasted across an entire supply chain. Using a
              paradox theory approach, the aim of this paper is to address
              these knowledge gaps by exploring the inherent paradoxes in
              resolving food waste across a supply chain. Drawing on in-depth
              qualitative research within the Australian horticulture industry,
              the findings reveal four macro-level paradoxes relating to
              policy, markets, responsibility, and marketing. This paper makes
              a novel contribution through consideration of a holistic, whole

              paradox theory into food waste scholarship. From a managerial
              perspective, the visibility of paradoxes highlights the need for
              organisations in the food supply chain to look beyond their own

              food waste quantiﬁcation are lacking. Existing studies on waste
              quantity assessments have several limitations, such as short and
              infrequent quantiﬁcations times, large methodological variations
              ranging from physical measurements to visual observations, and
              lack of comparability across catering unit types. Since lack of

              general framework is needed for waste quantiﬁcation in food

              comparisons when overlapping observations are included. The
              framework was tested in six case studies in professional (public

  abstract = "Waste recovery has become one of the most important strategies to
              reduce environmental issues and improve economic performance in
              industry. Thus, different systematic approaches have been
              developed for waste recovery. However, most of the developed
              waste recovery approaches do not account for the hidden cost
              incurred from various processing steps as a criterion for
              prioritisation of waste recovery. This aspect can be determined
              by the concept of material ﬂow cost accounting (MFCA). Hence, in
              this work, a novel MFCA-based approach is developed for
              prioritisation of waste recovery with consideration of hidden
              costs embedded in process streams. Two case studies are solved to
              illustrate the developed approach. It can be seen that hidden
              unit cost (HUC), carry-forward cost (CFC), amount and quality of
              discharged waste are important factors that signiﬁcantly affect
              the prioritisation results. The developed approach then balances
              the trade-off among these factors to determine the minimum total
              hidden cost (THC) of discharged waste, and thus improve the
              economic and environmental performances of an industrial process.",

  abstract = "It is essential for small and medium-sized enterprises to
              manufacture products using standardized and sustainable methods.
              The case study company here is a wood products manufacturer, and
              an analysis of its production process revealed that almost 70\%
              of the wood raw materials used is wasted in the form of
              chippings, sawdust, off-cuts and defects. The objective of this
              research study was therefore to apply the Material Flow Cost
              Accounting (MFCA) and Design of Experiments (DOE) concepts to the
              case study company, in order to reduce materials consumption and
              minimize waste. The research methodology was divided into two
              main parts. The ﬁrst part employed the MFCA concept to analyze
              the inefﬁciencies incurred due to resource use within the
              production process, as well as the causes of such inefﬁciencies.
              In the second part, the opportunities available to reduce these
              inefﬁciencies were examined. The DOE concept was used to increase
              the efﬁciency of wood raw materials use, with a full factorial
              experiment used to ﬁnd the optimal cutting settings, those
              creating less damage. Three factors were studied and an analysis
              of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. The results of the experiment
              have subsequently been put into practice, resulting in a
              reduction of wood materials losses in the cutting process, as a
              proportion of total wood materials used, from approximately 69
              percent to 54 percent. In conclusion, applying MFCA and DOE
              helped both increase product quality and reduce the adverse
              environmental impacts of the case study company's production
              process, saving costs and improving its competitiveness.",

  abstract = "Food waste has formidable detrimental impacts on food security,
              the environment, and the economy, which makes it a global
              challenge that requires urgent attention. This study investigates
              the patterns and causes of food waste generation in the
              hospitality and food service sector, with the aim of identifying
              the most promising food waste prevention measures. It presents a
              comparative analysis of ﬁve case studies from the hospitality and
              food service (HaFS) sector in Malaysia and uses a mixed-methods
              approach. This paper provides new empirical evidence to highlight
              the signiﬁcant opportunity and scope for food waste reduction in
              the HaFS sector. The ﬁndings suggest that the scale of the
              problem is even bigger than previously thought. Nearly a third of
              all food was wasted in the case studies presented, and almost
              half of it was avoidable. Preparation waste was the largest
              fraction, followed by buﬀet leftover and then customer plate
              waste. Food waste represented an economic loss equal to 23\% of
              the value of the food purchased. Causes of food waste generation
              included the restaurants' operating procedures and policies, and
              the social practices related to food consumption. Therefore, food
              waste prevention strategies should be twofold, tackling both the
              way the hospitality and food service sector outlets operate and
              organise themselves, and the customers' social practices related
              to food consumption.",

              their households. In the second step, participants were asked to
              maintain a food waste diary (FWD) for 21 days. They were

  abstract = "In recent years, food waste has received growing interest from
              local, national and European policymakers, international
              organisations, NGOs as well as academics from various
              disciplinary ﬁelds. Increasing concerns about food security and
              environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and greenhouse
              gas emissions attributed to food waste, have intensiﬁed attention
              to the topic. While food waste occurs in all stages of the food
              supply chain, private households have been identiﬁed as key
              actors in food waste generation. However, the evidence on why
              food waste occurs remains scattered. This paper maps the still
              small but expanding academic territory of consumer food waste by
              systematically reviewing empirical studies on food waste
              practices as well as distilling factors that foster and impede
              the generation of food waste on the household level. Moreover, we
              brieﬂy discuss the contributions of different social ontologies,
              more particularly psychology-related approaches and social
              practice theory. The analysis reveals food waste as a complex and
              multi-faceted issue that cannot be attributed to single
              variables; this also calls for a stronger integration of
              different disciplinary perspectives. Mapping the determinants of
              waste generation deepens the understanding of household practices
              and helps design food waste prevention strategies. Finally, we

  abstract = "There has been growing interest in establishing food waste
              prevention and recovery programs throughout the world. The drive
              to target food waste stems from increasing concerns about
              resource conservation, food security, food waste's environmental
              and economic costs, and a general trend in the waste management
              industry to transition to more sustainable practices. Here the
              drivers of residential, institutional, and commercial food waste
              generation in developed countries, particularly in the U.S., are
              explored. The impacts of food system modernization on food waste
              generation are examined, including impacts related to food system
              industrialization, urbanization, globalization, and economic
              growth. Socio-demographic, cultural, political, and economic
              drivers of food waste are described with emphasis on how food
              waste perspectives may vary globally. Specific behaviors and
              attitudes which result from many of these waste drivers are then
              discussed. The examination of the range of food wastage drivers
              are used to provide insight into the best policy approaches to
              sustainably manage food waste. Food waste prevention policies are
              placed in context of the waste generating behaviors and attitudes
              that they address. A review of important background information
              on food waste is also provided, including definitions of key
              terms, food waste history, quantities of food waste generated,
              and the importance of food waste prevention for sustainability,
              as this information is all critical for effective policy

  abstract  = "Sample size determination is among the most commonly encountered
               tasks in statistical practice. A broad range of frequentist and
               Bayesian methods for sample size determination can be described
               as choosing the smallest sample that is sufficient to achieve
               some set of goals. An example for the frequentist is seeking the
               smallest sample size that is sufficient to achieve a desired
               power at a specified significance level. An example for the
               Bayesian is seeking the smallest sample size necessary to
               obtain, in expectation, a desired rate of correct classification
               of the hypothesis as true or false. This article explores
               parallels between Bayesian and frequentist methods for
               determining sample size. We provide a simple but general and
               pragmatic framework for investigating the relationship between
               the two approaches, based on identifying mappings to connect the
               Bayesian and frequentist inputs necessary to obtain the same
               sample size. We illustrate this mapping with examples,

  abstract = "The aim of this study was to measure the food waste that occurs
              in Dutch households through a new, combined approach. The methods
              used were a sorting analysis of solid household waste from 130
              households in 13 municipalities and a consumer survey given to
              763 respondents. An estimation survey on liquid waste was given
              to 1105 respondents via a phone app. According to the consumer
              survey, consumers throw away 21.2 kg of food (solid and liquid)
              per person, per year. This appears to be an underestimation. The
              main part, 60.2\%, is discarded via household waste, 29.6\% goes
              down the sink or toilet and 10.2\% is thrown away via other
              pathways. The sorting analysis shows that solid food waste
              (including sauces, fats and dairy products) via household waste
              amounts to 30.4 kilo per person, per year. Based on the
              distribution across the various pathways, it is calculated that
              10.8 kg of solid food is wasted via other pathways. Together,
              this was 41.2 kg per person in 2016 (less than the 48 kg in 2010
              and 47 kg in 2013). This decrease is not significant. Solid food
              waste accounts for 13.0\% of all food purchased. The most wasted
              solid foods are bread (22\%), dairy products (17\%), vegetables
              (14\%), fruit (12\%) and meat (7\%) ( See Table 1). A new method
              is used to estimate liquid waste via sinks and toilets; this
              waste amounts to 57.3 L per person, per year: 50.7 L of beverages
              (including milk) and 6.6 L of thick liquids. The waste volumes

  abstract  = "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine and quantify
               the most dominant types of food waste in Hungarian households
               and to analyse the effect of demographic background and income
               as influencing factors.Design/methodology/approach Data related
               to solid and liquid food waste were recorded from 100 households
               for one week. The study primarily focussed on avoidable food
               waste, however, unavoidable and potentially avoidable food waste
               were also measured. Appropriate tools and manual were provided
               to the households to ensure data consistency.Findings Estimated
               quantity of total food waste (including liquid waste) per capita
               is 68.04 kg/year. In all, 48.70 per cent of total food waste
               would have been avoidable (equals to 33.14 kg/capita/year). Most
               frequently wasted food categories were meals and bakery
               products. In case of some demographic categories, different
               wastage levels were observed. It was also confirmed that income
               has effect on food waste production that varies by foodstuff
               categories: bakery product waste was mainly dominant for middle
               income consumers and fresh fruits were typically wasted by more
               affluent households. Apart from that, higher income resulted in
               higher food waste production in general.Practical implications
               This primary data set about avoidable food waste in Hungary
               contributes with relevant information to the refining of
               international estimates. Having specific data on food wastage
               and the most affected target groups, as well as information on
               the impact of the income can be applied in planning awareness
               raising campaigns.Originality/value The research is based on
               measurement of food waste categories in households resulting in
               detailed data sets. This study is one of the first
               investigations based on primary data collection from the eastern
               part of Central Europe and the very first related to Hungary.
               The study draws attention also to the influence that household
               income exerts on the issue of food waste.",

               and has economic, environmental and social consequences. This
               study focuses on a solution developed in Portugal for a specific
               type of waste, vegetables and fruits discarded by farmers due to
               aesthetic reasons. Although with the same quality, their
               appearance is not within the requirements set by the main
               retailers and therefore not commercialized and consumed. The
               project developed to tackle this problem is a non-profit co-op,
               called Fruta Feia (Ugly Fruit) that commercializes this type of
               products that farmers cannot sell through the conventional
               channels. Tested successfully in Lisbon region, is now being

  abstract  = "There is growing awareness of the positive impact of reducing
               the amount of wasted food on greenhouse gas emissions, energy
               use, food and water security, and land use. In developed
               nations, food waste generated in homes is a large contributor to
               the total amount of food waste. The behaviours and practices
               associated with this waste prevention (and waste generation) are
               complex for a number of reasons: food waste is the result of
               multiple, interacting activities and this leads to separation
               between the activity and their consequences. These behaviours
               are usually performed for reasons unrelated to waste prevention
               and have both a marked habitual element and a pronounced
               emotional component. Furthermore, the prevention of food waste
               has less `visibility' to other people (e.g. neighbours) than
               many other pro-environmental behaviours (e.g. recycling), and
               therefore social norms around `waste' play a reduced role
               compared to more `visible' activities. This paper discusses
               insights into these behaviours from research funded by the Waste
               \& Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and its partners in the UK.
               It discusses how these insights have been used in the
               development of a successful public-engagement campaign, which
               has been influential in the recent reduction in household food
               waste. These insights are also discussed in light of commonly
               used behavioural models, highlighting that many of these models
               are not designed for multiple, complex behaviours. However,
               considering the subject of food waste through the `lenses' of
               different academic disciplines has helped the development of the
               public engagement on this issue.",

               consumption is wasted across the food supply chain. In the high
               income countries, the food waste generated at the household
               level represents about half of the total food waste, making this
               level one of the biggest contributors to food waste. Yet, there
               is still little evidence regarding the determinants of
               consumers' food waste behaviour. The present study examines the
               effect of psycho-social factors, food-related routines,
               household perceived capabilities and socio-demographic
               characteristics on self-reported food waste. Survey data
               gathered among 1062 Danish respondents measured consumers'
               intentions not to waste food, planning, shopping and reuse of
               leftovers routines, perceived capability to deal with household
               food-related activities, injunctive and moral norms, attitudes

               show that perceived behavioural control and routines related to
               shopping and reuse of leftovers are the main drivers of food
               waste, while planning routines contribute indirectly. In turn,
               the routines are related to consumers' perceived capabilities to
               deal with household related activities. With regard to
               intentional processes, injunctive norms and attitudes towards
               food waste have an impact while moral norms and perceived

              food waste using direct-weighing from 218 households in Daegu,
              South Korea was used to assess the environmental (carbon
              footprint, and water footprint) and economic (wasted cost)
              impacts associated with their wastage. For the first time, the
              Environmental-Economic (EN-EC) Footprint index is proposed as a
              single indicator for environmental and economic impacts to assess
              the hotspot food waste products among the selected 42 major food
              waste items. This study presents that the selected food products
              had a significant contribution to an average edible food waste
              generation of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.06 kg (per household/day), 0.71 $\pm$
              0.05 kg CO2eq of GHG emissions, 0.46 $\pm$ 0.04 m3 of water
              footprint, and 3855.93 $\pm$ 527.27 won of economic loss,
              respectively. Based on the newly developed EN-EC Footprint index,
              we found that wasted animal-based food products had relatively
              high environmental and economic losses compared to
              non-animal-based food products. The findings of this study
              presented a novel method of estimating combined environmental and
              economic impacts associated with household food waste, which may
              further act as convenient guides for the waste management

              increasingly seeing food waste as a key sustainability issue and
              as an under-utilized resource. Conversely, wasted food,
              simplistically defined as uneaten edible food, is largely
              generated at the consumer level either at or away from home.
              Given the complex social context related to food preferences,
              customs and the degree of awareness at the consumer level,
              reducing waste in home may be difficult without technology and

  abstract  = "The use of garbage grinders is not a usual practice in Europe,
               but it is in other countries around the world (e.g., North
               America, Japan and Australia). Sometimes, garbage grinders are
               accused of producing problems in sewers and wastewater treatment
               plants and are prohibited by environmental protection laws. In
               this study, the different impacts determined by the use of this
               technology were considered to show the positive impacts of its
               use. In particular, it was shown that garbage grinders enable
               the disposal of household organic wastes with advantages for the
               wastewater treatment processes because of an increase in the
               carbon/nutrients ratio in the wastewater. This is particularly
               important for biological nutrients removal processes. Daily
               specific contributions for person equivalent (PE) due to organic
               waste disposal through garbage grinders were found to be equal
               to 75 gCODPE(-1) d(-1) for carbon (as COD), 2.5 gNPE(-1) d(-1)
               for nitrogen and 0.25 gPPE(-1) d(-1) for phosphorous,
               respectively. Those determined a value of 30 for the COD/N

               noted. These results were extensively compared with literature

               grinders allowed a global saving of some 17 Euro year(-1) for a

               methods. Bayesian approaches in particular offer tremendous
               flexibility for SCR modeling. Increasingly, SCR data are being
               collected over very large spatial extents making analysis
               computational intensive, sometimes prohibitively so. To mitigate
               the computational burden of large-scale SCR models, we developed
               an improved formulation of the Bayesian SCR model that uses
               local evaluation of the individual state-space (LESS). Based on
               prior knowledge about a species' home range size, we created
               square evaluation windows that restrict the spatial domain in
               which an individual's detection probability (detector window)
               and activity center location (AC window) are estimated. We used
               simulations and empirical data analyses to assess the
               performance and bias of SCR with LESS. LESS produced unbiased
               estimates of SCR parameters when the AC window width was
               $\geq$5$\sigma$ ($\sigma$: the scale parameter of the
               half-normal detection function), and when the detector window
               extended beyond the edge of the AC window by 2$\sigma$.
               Importantly, LESS considerably decreased the computation time
               needed for fitting SCR models. In our simulations, LESS
               increased the computation speed of SCR models up to 57-fold. We
               demonstrate the power of this new approach by mapping the
               density of an elusive large carnivore-the wolverine (Gulo
               gulo)-with an unprecedented resolution and across the species'
               entire range in Norway (> 200,000 km2). Our approach helps
               overcome a major computational obstacle to population and
               landscape-level SCR analyses. The LESS implementation in a
               Bayesian framework makes the customization and fitting of SCR

               model with explicit sentiment factors in a period including the
               global financial crisis, where market confidence was said to
               erode considerably. It utilizes a large text data of real time,
               relatively high-frequency market news and takes account of the
               difficulties in incorporating market sentiment into the models.
               To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use
               this category of data in term-structure models. Although market
               sentiment or market confidence is often regarded as an important
               driver of asset markets, it is not explicitly incorporated in
               traditional empirical factor models for daily yield curve data
               because they are unobservable. To overcome this problem, we use
               a text mining approach to generate observable variables which
               are driven by otherwise unobservable sentiment factors. Then,
               applying the Monte Carlo filter as a filtering method in a state
               space Bayesian filtering approach, we estimate the dynamic
               stochastic structure of these latent factors from observable
               variables driven by these latent variables. As a result, the
               three-factor model with text mining is able to distinguish (1) a
               spread-steepening factor which is driven by pessimists' view and
               explaining the spreads related to ultra-long term yields from
               (2) a spread-flattening factor which is driven by optimists'
               view and influencing the long and medium term spreads. Also, the
               three-factor model with text mining has better fitting to the
               observed yields than the model without text mining. Moreover, we
               collect market participants' views about specific spreads in the
               term structure and find that the movement of the identified
               sentiment factors are consistent with the market participants'
               views, and thus market sentiment.",

  abstract  = "In the past several years, the liberalization of the electricity
               supply, the increase in variability of electric appliances and
               their use, and the need to respond to the electricity demand in
               real time has made electricity demand forecasting a challenge.
               To this challenge, many solutions are being proposed. The
               electricity demand involves many sources such as economic
               activities, household need and weather sources. All of these
               sources make electricity demand forecasting difficult. To
               forecast the electricity demand, some proposed parametric
               methods that integrate main variables that are sources of
               electricity demand. Others proposed a non parametric method such
               as pattern recognition methods. In this paper, we propose to
               take only the past electricity consumption information embedded
               in a functional vector autoregressive state space model to
               forecast the future electricity demand. The model we proposed
               aims to be applied at some aggregation level between regional
               and nation-wide grids. To estimate the parameters of this model,
               we use likelihood maximization, spline smoothing, functional
               principal components analysis and Kalman filtering. Through
               numerical experiments on real datasets, both from supplier
               Enercoop and from the Transmission System Operator of the French

  abstract  = "Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential
               component of applied statistical inference. Ecologists
               increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in
               their research. The appeal of this modeling paradigm is
               undeniable, as researchers can build and fit models that embody
               complex ecological processes while simultaneously accounting for
               observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less focused
               on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of
               fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more
               traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There
               are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models,
               each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance,
               Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well
               known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5.
               Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such
               as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability
               integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce
               more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not
               as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and
               targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of
               different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels
               of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or
               spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing
               literature to guide ecologists through the many available
               options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and
               procedures with several ecological case studies including (1)
               analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture
               models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft,
               and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns
               of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that
               commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values
               detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more
               subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and
               pivot discrepancy measures (including the ``sampled predictive P
               value'') appear to be better suited to model checking and to
               have better overall statistical performance. We conclude that
               model checking is necessary to ensure that scientific inference
               is well founded. As an essential component of scientific
               discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses presented
               in the literature.",

  abstract  = "[This paper develops an asymptotic theory for residual based
               tests for cointegration. These tests involve procedures that are
               designed to detect the presence of a unit root in the residuals
               of (cointegrating) regressions among the levels of economic time
               series. Attention is given to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)
               test that is recommended by Engle-Granger (1987) and the
               Z$\alpha$ and Zt unit root tests recently proposed by Phillips
               (1987). Two new tests are also introduced, one of which is
               invariant to the normalization of the cointegrating regression.
               All of these tests are shown to be asymptotically similar and
               simple representations of their limiting distributions are given
               in terms of standard Brownian motion. The ADF and Zt tests are
               asymptotically equivalent. Power properties of the tests are
               also studied. The analysis shows that all the tests are
               consistent if suitably constructed but that the ADF and Zt tests
               have slower rates of divergence under cointegration than the
               other tests. This indicates that, at least in large samples, the
               Z$\alpha$ test should have superior power properties. The paper
               concludes by addressing the larger issue of test formulation.
               Some major pitfalls are discovered in procedures that are
               designed to test a null of cointegration (rather than no
               cointegration). These defects provide strong arguments against
               the indiscriminate use of such test formulations and support the
               continuing use of residual based unit root tests. A full set of
               critical values for residual based tests is included. These

               variable for each month contain calendar effects due to changing
               month length, day-of-the-week effects, and holidays. It is
               important to remove the calendar variation to allow an effective
               assessment of the variation due to important factors. New
               procedures for calendar adjustment are presented in this
               article. A plausible model for the daily data is used to derive
               a model for the monthly data in which the power transformed,
               month-length corrected data are equal to trend plus seasonal
               plus calendar plus irregular. The procedure for fitting the
               calendar component in the monthly model is (a) divide the
               aggregated monthly data by month length and multiply by 30.4375,
               the average month length; (b) choose a power transformation; (c)
               remove trend and seasonal components; (d) estimate the calendar
               parameters by robust regression. Since the model is only a
               hypothesis it is important to check its validity. This can be
               done by various residual plots in the regression analysis and by
               using spectrum analysis and time-domain graphical methods to

  abstract = "The R package walker extends standard Bayesian general linear
              models to the case where the effects of the explanatory variables
              can vary in time. This allows, for example, to model the effects
              of interventions such as changes in tax policy which gradually
              increases their effect over time. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
              algorithms powering the Bayesian inference are based on
              Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provided by Stan software, using a state
              space representation of the model to marginalize over the
              regression coefficients for efficient low-dimensional sampling.",

               The results did not support the use of rules-of-thumb that
               simply specify some constant (e.g., 100 subjects) as the minimum
               number of subjects or a minimum ratio of number of subjects (N)

               rule-of-thumb that N $\geq$ 50 + 8 m for the multiple
               correlation and N $\geq$104 + m for the partial correlation.
               However, the rule-of-thumb for the multiple correlation yields
               values too large for N when m $\geq$ 7, and both rules-of-thumb

  abstract = "Regression models such as the Cox proportional hazards model have
              had increasing use in modelling and estimating the prognosis of
              patients with a variety of diseases. Many applications involve a
              large number of variables to be modelled using a relatively small
              patient sample. Problems of overfitting and of identifying
              important covariates are exacerbated in analysing prognosis
              because the accuracy of a model is more a function of the number
              of events than of the sample size. We used a general index of
              predictive discrimination to measure the ability of a model
              developed on training samples of varying sizes to predict
              survival in an independent test sample of patients suspected of
              having coronary artery disease. We compared three methods of
              model fitting: (1) standard 'step-up' variable selection, (2)
              incomplete principal components regression, and (3) Cox model
              regression after developing clinical indices from variable
              clusters. We found regression using principal components to offer
              superior predictions in the test sample, whereas regression using
              indices offers easily interpretable models nearly as good as the
              principal components models. Standard variable selection has a
              number of deficiencies.",
