# Introduction
## Introduction
Food Loss and Waste (FLW) happens everywhere.

<!-- World -->
- One-third of food is lost or wasted around the world[1].
- Around 1.3 billion tons of FWL is generated annually, and the rate is projected to grow by 44% per year by 2025[2].

<!-- Canada -->
- Canada creates about 35 million tons and the largest waste generator per capita in western countries in 2016[3].
- Canada's avoidable FLW is 49.5 million CAD[4].

## Introduction
<!-- BC -->
- In BC, 40% of the waste to landfills is organic waste, the majority is produced from domestic waste[5].

<!-- Domestic Studies -->
- Recent huge discoveries in the food waste research focus on waste generated by households:[6,7,8,9].
<!-- (Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2015; Lusk & Ellison, 2017; Nahman et al., 2012; Von Massow et al., 2019). -->

<!-- Food Service -->
- Limited number of studies done on the food supply side.
- Even little esimations of FLW in food service industry. 


## Introduction
### Research Questions

- What is the average volume of food that is wasted during processing and consumption in restaurants?
- What is the extent of food wastage in Japanese restaurants in Prince George?
- What are the main factors contributing to food loss and waste?
- To what extent is a social or environmental impact from food loss waste generated by a
single restaurant?
- What approaches are Japanese restaurant operators taking to reduce food waste generation?

# Literature Review
## Literature Review
### Definition of FLW
- No universally accepted definitions of FLW

| Organizations | Definition |
|---            |---         |
|Food Loss by FAO | harvest/slaughter/catch | retail/ consumption |
|Food Waste by FAO | retail/ consumption |
|Food Waste by EU | Food removed from FSC |
|Food Loss by US | unused product from agri |
|Food Waste by US | Subcomponent of FL |
(Source [10])

## Literature Review
### Definition of FLW
- Food Loss: generated by provider
- Food Waste: generated by consumers

## Literature Review
### Five Measurements of FLW

| Method | Note |
|---     |---   |
|1.Self-report | individuals report FLW |
|              | low cost but high dropouts |
|2.Survey | collect FLW by interview or questionnaire |
|         | cost-effective but not accurate |
|3.Composition | sample and analysis at lab |
|              | need special knowledge and equipment |
|4.Mass balance | material flow analysis |
|               | limitation in waste factor assumptions |
|5.**Direct weight** | directly measure FLW |
|                    | most accurate but high cost |

## Literature Review
### Statistic Model
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Ad: Simple and interpretable
- Disad: Not suitable to time series 
- Disad: Stationary and Spurious

- **Bayesian Modelling**
- Ad: Flexible and adaptable to time series data
- Disad: No appropriate result in some cases

## Literature Review
### Effects of Food Loss and Waste

- **Economic Loss**:
- labour, material resources, time, and energy

- **Environmental Impacts**:
- water pollution, deforestation, soil erosion, and GHG


Reducing FLW can mitigate these economic and environmental impacts. 
Through better supply chain management, reducing consumer food waste, and increasing food recovery.

## Literature Review
### Hypotheses

- Estimate average FLW
- Any patterns between FLW and business operations
- Any patterns between FLW and weather conditions
- Estimate economic and environmental impacts


# Methods
## Methods
### Study Area
- Japanese restaurant located a suburban area of Prince George
- lunch and dinner for three hours each
- six days of a week: from Tuesday to Sunday

## Methods
### Sample Collection
Busket for Food Loss       |  Busket and Strainer for Food Waste
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](busket.jpg){width=30%}|  ![](busketStrainer.jpg){width=35%}




## Methods
### Sample Size
- **Power analysis**, 95% CI and 20% margin of error with 10 explanatory variables says 110 samples.
<!-- pwr.f2.test(u=10, v=NULL, f2=0.15, sig.level=0.05, power=0.8) -->
- **Rule-of-thumb**, one in ten rule suggests 100 observations with 10 predictors[11]
- Green's rule states 130 samples with 10 predictors[12] 

## Methods
### Variables

| Variables | Note |
|---     |---   |
|1.Food Loss         | Daily disposed food by kitchen |
|2.Liquid Food Waste | Daily disposed liquid food by customers |
|3.Solid Food Waste  | Daily disposed solid food by customers |
|4.Number of Customers | Daily Number of dine-in customers |
|5.Sales | Daily sales |
|6.Liquor   | Daily Number of liquors sold |
|7.Takeouts | Daily Number of takeout sold |
|8.Orders   | Daily Number of orders sold |
|9.Temperature | Hourly mean temperature each day |
|10.Humidity   | Hourly mean humidity each day |
|11.Precipitation | Precipitation each day |

## Methods
### Multiple Linear Regression Model (additive)
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &=  X\beta + \epsilon\\
\epsilon_i &\overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} N(\mu=0, \sigma^2).
\end{aligned}
$$

### Baysian Modelling
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= X\beta_i + \epsilon\\
\beta_{i} &\sim N(\beta_{i-1}, \sigma_{\beta}^2)\\
\epsilon_i &\sim N(0, \sigma_{y}^2).
\end{aligned}
$$
