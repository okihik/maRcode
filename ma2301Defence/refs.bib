  abstract  = "Valorisation of municipal organic waste through larval feeding
               activity of the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens,
               constitutes a potential benefit, especially for low and
               middle-income countries. Besides waste reduction and
               stabilisation, the product in form of the last larval stage, the
               so-called prepupae, offers a valuable additive in animal feed,
               opening new economic niches for small entrepreneurs in
               developing countries. We have therefore evaluated the
               feasibility of the black soldier fly larvae to digest and
               degrade mixed municipal organic waste in a medium-scale field
               experiment in Costa Rica, and explored the benefits and
               limitations of this technology. We achieved an average prepupae
               production of 252 g/m2/day (wet weight) under favourable
               conditions. Waste reduction ranged from 65.5 to 78.9\% depending
               on the daily amount of waste added to the experimental unit and
               presence/absence of a drainage system. Three factors strongly
               influenced larval yield and waste reduction capacity: (1) high
               larval mortality due to elevated zinc concentrations in the
               waste material and anaerobic conditions in the experimental
               trays; (2) lack of fertile eggs due to zinc poisoning, and (3)
               limited access to food from stagnating liquid in the
               experimental trays. This study confirmed the great potential of
               this fly as a waste manager in low and middle-income countries,
               but also identified knowledge gaps pertaining to biological
               larvae requirements (egg hatching rate, moisture tolerance, …)
               and process design (drainage, rearing facilities, …) to be
               tackled in future research.",

  author   = "Bollen, Kenneth A and Jackman, Robert W",
  abstract = "Gauging the robustness of regression estimates is especially
              important in small-sample analyses. Here, we examine recent
              developments in the detection and analysis of outliers and
              influential cases in multivariate studies. Specifically, we
              review five diagnostic procedures: partial regression plots, the
              ``hat'' matrix, studentized residuals, DFITSi, and DFBETASij. The
              main part of the article presents two empirical applications
              (drawn from recent cross-national studies) that show (a) how the
              diagnostic procedures can be incorporated into the research
              process, and (b) what we can learn from them. These applications
              serve to underscore the point that the diagnostics cannot be
              employed mechanically. Instead, once a case is diagnosed as
              influential, remedial action requires a firm substantive
              grounding. Although case deletion may be warranted in some
              circumstances, it is an extreme remedy of last resort that should
              not be routinely followed. The more fruitful approach is to ask
              why a given case is influential. As our applications indicate,
              the diagnostics can be helpful in isolating such problems as
              sample composition, specification error, and errors in
              measurement.",

  abstract = "To derive new methods for converting food and green wastes into
              soil amendment, this study researched on a in-vessel composting
              system. The performance of an in-vessel composting system was
              evaluated during food and green wastes digestion. A series of
              experiments was conducted using both pilot-scale and bench-scale
              in-vessel systems. During the digestion process, external heat
              and continuous mixing were provided for achieving the typical
              composting temperature of 60 °C. The feedstock included food
              waste, horse manure, palm-tree waste, and green waste. The
              digestate was tested for understanding the inactivation of
              pathogens (Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella enterica
              serovar Typhimurium LT2 (Salmonella)). Subsequently, pathogen
              inactivation models were developed to determine the quantitative
              time-dependent relationships between digestion time and potential
              pathogen cells in digestate. The digestate was also analyzed for
              evaluating the changes in pH, moisture level, variations in
              carbon content, and carbon to nitrogen ratio during the digestion
              process. Further, the effects of additives on the digestion
              process and digestate were evaluated by comparing the digestate
              quality under additive and without additives conditions. Results
              showed that the proposed method produced a pathogen-free soil
              amendment from the food and green wastes. The pH and moisture
              content of the digestate of pilot-scale experiment varied from
              3.8 to 4 and 60.6--67.9\%, respectively. The observations showed
              that E. coli survived greater than 10 h, while Salmonella counts
              were not detectable beyond 40 min of digestion. The results of
              predictive models showed that Salmonella could survive till 80
              min during in-vessel composting at 60 °C, while the elimination
              of E. coli may take 16--25 h. The authors anticipate that the
              in-vessel digestion system, which is proposed here, will help in
              accelerating the conversion of organic waste into pathogen-free
              soil amendment, thereby, enhancing sustainable agriculture.",

              causes of food waste occurrence at a retail store level across
              different store formats and product categories. To achieve this,
              we ﬁrst conducted case studies, including semi-structured
              interviews with store managers. This exploratory research
              involved 28 cases across dominant retail store formats (i.e.,
              super- and hypermarkets and discount and convenience stores). The
              results along with secondary data research underlie a process
              simulation modeling approach that quantiﬁes the impact of
              selected root causes of food waste by considering the
              dependencies between them. Finally, we conducted semi-structured
              interviews with 12 food waste experts to conﬁrm ﬁndings of the
              case studies and simulations and to delineate the practical
              implications of our research and the related solutions. Our
              ﬁndings show that the root causes of food waste are related to
              undesirable customer behavior and erratic demand, inefﬁcient
              store operations and replenishment policies, and elevated product
              (quality) requirements of both retail organizations and
              customers. Root causes and their impacts differ across store
              formats and product categories. Furthermore, the

              spheres of responsibility and inﬂuence (i.e., customers, the
              store, and the parent organization) are evident. The paper

              of retail operations related to the occurrence of food waste

  abstract = "Food waste prevention has gained greater relevance on the
              political agenda over the last decade. However, the involvement
              of municipal actors in pushing the issue forward has been
              comparatively limited. Based on the cases of the German cities of
              Munich and Cologne, this paper examines the possible approaches
              to prevent food waste at the municipal level and their relevance
              on the local agenda. It ﬁrst proposes a deﬁnition of local food
              waste prevention policies and presents an overview of options for
              municipal actors. Based on the analysis of own interview data and
              secondary sources, it then applies Kingdon's Multiple Streams
              Framework to gain insights on the agenda-setting processes in the
              two cities concerning the issue. The results suggest that policy
              entrepreneurs, a strategic framing, and networking with other
              political levels favour the rise of food waste prevention on the
              local agenda. The main hindering factors identiﬁed are problem
              load and budgetary constraints, as well as the lack of strong
              political interest groups and a perceived spatial mismatch
              between problem and solutions. The ﬁndings provide starting
              points for (i) the further investigation of the so far
              under-researched potentials and limitations of municipal food
              waste prevention as well as for (ii) local (network) activities

  abstract = "Research on on food waste is often reductionist, in that it
              attempts to measure food waste at single points within the supply
              chain. While this enables consideration of where food is being
              wasted within the supply chain, it does not necessarily answer
              why and how food is wasted across an entire supply chain. Using a
              paradox theory approach, the aim of this paper is to address
              these knowledge gaps by exploring the inherent paradoxes in
              resolving food waste across a supply chain. Drawing on in-depth
              qualitative research within the Australian horticulture industry,
              the findings reveal four macro-level paradoxes relating to
              policy, markets, responsibility, and marketing. This paper makes
              a novel contribution through consideration of a holistic, whole
              of chain perspective in relation to food waste. It also extends
              paradox theory into food waste scholarship. From a managerial
              perspective, the visibility of paradoxes highlights the need for
              organisations in the food supply chain to look beyond their own
              organisational boundaries and adopt a whole-of-chain approach in
              an attempt to address food waste.",

              food waste quantiﬁcation are lacking. Existing studies on waste
              quantity assessments have several limitations, such as short and
              infrequent quantiﬁcations times, large methodological variations
              ranging from physical measurements to visual observations, and
              lack of comparability across catering unit types. Since lack of
              comparable waste ﬁgures can lead to error-prone analysis, a
              general framework is needed for waste quantiﬁcation in food
              services. This paper presents one such framework that allows data
              comparisons when overlapping observations are included. The
              framework was tested in six case studies in professional (public
              and private) catering units in Sweden. Data were collected from
              diﬀerent schools, elderly care homes and hotels and ﬁtted into

              developed for waste recovery. However, most of the developed
              waste recovery approaches do not account for the hidden cost
              incurred from various processing steps as a criterion for

              prioritisation of waste recovery with consideration of hidden
              costs embedded in process streams. Two case studies are solved to
              illustrate the developed approach. It can be seen that hidden

              discharged waste are important factors that signiﬁcantly affect
              the prioritisation results. The developed approach then balances
              the trade-off among these factors to determine the minimum total
              hidden cost (THC) of discharged waste, and thus improve the

              an analysis of its production process revealed that almost 70\%
              of the wood raw materials used is wasted in the form of
              chippings, sawdust, off-cuts and defects. The objective of this
              research study was therefore to apply the Material Flow Cost
              Accounting (MFCA) and Design of Experiments (DOE) concepts to the
              case study company, in order to reduce materials consumption and
              minimize waste. The research methodology was divided into two
              main parts. The ﬁrst part employed the MFCA concept to analyze
              the inefﬁciencies incurred due to resource use within the
              production process, as well as the causes of such inefﬁciencies.
              In the second part, the opportunities available to reduce these
              inefﬁciencies were examined. The DOE concept was used to increase
              the efﬁciency of wood raw materials use, with a full factorial
              experiment used to ﬁnd the optimal cutting settings, those
              creating less damage. Three factors were studied and an analysis

  abstract = "Food waste has formidable detrimental impacts on food security,
              the environment, and the economy, which makes it a global
              challenge that requires urgent attention. This study investigates
              the patterns and causes of food waste generation in the
              hospitality and food service sector, with the aim of identifying
              the most promising food waste prevention measures. It presents a
              comparative analysis of ﬁve case studies from the hospitality and
              food service (HaFS) sector in Malaysia and uses a mixed-methods
              approach. This paper provides new empirical evidence to highlight
              the signiﬁcant opportunity and scope for food waste reduction in
              the HaFS sector. The ﬁndings suggest that the scale of the
              problem is even bigger than previously thought. Nearly a third of
              all food was wasted in the case studies presented, and almost
              half of it was avoidable. Preparation waste was the largest
              fraction, followed by buﬀet leftover and then customer plate
              waste. Food waste represented an economic loss equal to 23\% of
              the value of the food purchased. Causes of food waste generation
              included the restaurants' operating procedures and policies, and
              the social practices related to food consumption. Therefore, food
              waste prevention strategies should be twofold, tackling both the
              way the hospitality and food service sector outlets operate and
              organise themselves, and the customers' social practices related
              to food consumption.",

  abstract = "The huge amount of food wasted at the consumer or household level
              has severe environmental and economic consequences. In the
              present work, we compared two self-report measures for the
              assessment of food waste quantities at the household level in
              Switzerland. Participants (N = 223) were asked to complete an
              online food waste questionnaire (FWQ), in which they were
              instructed to report the average amount of food waste produced in
              their households. In the second step, participants were asked to
              maintain a food waste diary (FWD) for 21 days. They were
              instructed to write down all food waste items, including their
              relative amounts, as well as the reason and method for their
              disposal. Using correlation and regression analyses, we found
              that the amount of food waste reported on the FWQ and in the FWD
              were highly correlated, revealing similar patterns in terms of
              their psychological predictors. In the context of the range of
              different methods available for the assessment of household food
              waste, our study has provided valuable insights into two of the
              most used self-report measures. Similarities between and
              limitations of the methods have also been discussed. This
              knowledge can be used to contextualise the available results, to
              design future studies, and ultimately, to help develop

  author   = "Schanes, Karin and Dobernig, Karin and G{\"o}zet, Burcu",
  abstract = "In recent years, food waste has received growing interest from
              local, national and European policymakers, international
              organisations, NGOs as well as academics from various
              disciplinary ﬁelds. Increasing concerns about food security and
              environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and greenhouse
              gas emissions attributed to food waste, have intensiﬁed attention
              to the topic. While food waste occurs in all stages of the food
              supply chain, private households have been identiﬁed as key
              actors in food waste generation. However, the evidence on why
              food waste occurs remains scattered. This paper maps the still
              small but expanding academic territory of consumer food waste by
              systematically reviewing empirical studies on food waste
              practices as well as distilling factors that foster and impede
              the generation of food waste on the household level. Moreover, we
              brieﬂy discuss the contributions of different social ontologies,
              more particularly psychology-related approaches and social
              practice theory. The analysis reveals food waste as a complex and
              multi-faceted issue that cannot be attributed to single
              variables; this also calls for a stronger integration of
              different disciplinary perspectives. Mapping the determinants of
              waste generation deepens the understanding of household practices
              and helps design food waste prevention strategies. Finally, we
              link the identiﬁed factors with a set of policy, business, and
              retailer options.",

  abstract = "There has been growing interest in establishing food waste
              prevention and recovery programs throughout the world. The drive
              to target food waste stems from increasing concerns about
              resource conservation, food security, food waste's environmental
              and economic costs, and a general trend in the waste management
              industry to transition to more sustainable practices. Here the
              drivers of residential, institutional, and commercial food waste
              generation in developed countries, particularly in the U.S., are
              explored. The impacts of food system modernization on food waste
              generation are examined, including impacts related to food system
              industrialization, urbanization, globalization, and economic
              growth. Socio-demographic, cultural, political, and economic
              drivers of food waste are described with emphasis on how food
              waste perspectives may vary globally. Specific behaviors and
              attitudes which result from many of these waste drivers are then
              discussed. The examination of the range of food wastage drivers
              are used to provide insight into the best policy approaches to
              sustainably manage food waste. Food waste prevention policies are
              placed in context of the waste generating behaviors and attitudes
              that they address. A review of important background information
              on food waste is also provided, including definitions of key
              terms, food waste history, quantities of food waste generated,
              and the importance of food waste prevention for sustainability,
              as this information is all critical for effective policy
              development.",

              in Dutch households through a new, combined approach. The methods
              used were a sorting analysis of solid household waste from 130
              households in 13 municipalities and a consumer survey given to
              763 respondents. An estimation survey on liquid waste was given
              to 1105 respondents via a phone app. According to the consumer
              survey, consumers throw away 21.2 kg of food (solid and liquid)
              per person, per year. This appears to be an underestimation. The
              main part, 60.2\%, is discarded via household waste, 29.6\% goes
              down the sink or toilet and 10.2\% is thrown away via other
              pathways. The sorting analysis shows that solid food waste
              (including sauces, fats and dairy products) via household waste
              amounts to 30.4 kilo per person, per year. Based on the
              distribution across the various pathways, it is calculated that
              10.8 kg of solid food is wasted via other pathways. Together,
              this was 41.2 kg per person in 2016 (less than the 48 kg in 2010
              and 47 kg in 2013). This decrease is not significant. Solid food
              waste accounts for 13.0\% of all food purchased. The most wasted
              solid foods are bread (22\%), dairy products (17\%), vegetables
              (14\%), fruit (12\%) and meat (7\%) ( See Table 1). A new method
              is used to estimate liquid waste via sinks and toilets; this
              waste amounts to 57.3 L per person, per year: 50.7 L of beverages
              (including milk) and 6.6 L of thick liquids. The waste volumes

               America, Japan and Australia). Sometimes, garbage grinders are
               accused of producing problems in sewers and wastewater treatment
               plants and are prohibited by environmental protection laws. In
               this study, the different impacts determined by the use of this
               technology were considered to show the positive impacts of its
               use. In particular, it was shown that garbage grinders enable
               the disposal of household organic wastes with advantages for the
               wastewater treatment processes because of an increase in the
               carbon/nutrients ratio in the wastewater. This is particularly
               important for biological nutrients removal processes. Daily
               specific contributions for person equivalent (PE) due to organic
               waste disposal through garbage grinders were found to be equal
               to 75 gCODPE(-1) d(-1) for carbon (as COD), 2.5 gNPE(-1) d(-1)
               for nitrogen and 0.25 gPPE(-1) d(-1) for phosphorous,

               grinders allowed a global saving of some 17 Euro year(-1) for a
               three people family. Important benefits are also gained from an

              and evaluated thermal strategies of pyrolysis and combustion.
              Pyrolysis was a mild endothermic process with considerable H2O,
              CO2, and hydrocarbon releasing, and the LDS-derived biochar had
              pore structures and abundant functional groups. Combustion was
              exothermic in a broad temperature interval of 140 °C--580 °C with
              emissions of H2O, CO2, and NH3, but the process was mild and
              slow, revealing the poor combustibility of LDS, in addition, the
              ash had a medium deposition tendency. According to the results
              obtained in this study, pyrolysis was suggested as a more

               ecology that cannot be addressed with traditional nonspatial
               methods. Bayesian approaches in particular offer tremendous
               flexibility for SCR modeling. Increasingly, SCR data are being
               collected over very large spatial extents making analysis
               computational intensive, sometimes prohibitively so. To mitigate
               the computational burden of large-scale SCR models, we developed
               an improved formulation of the Bayesian SCR model that uses
               local evaluation of the individual state-space (LESS). Based on
               prior knowledge about a species' home range size, we created
               square evaluation windows that restrict the spatial domain in
               which an individual's detection probability (detector window)
               and activity center location (AC window) are estimated. We used
               simulations and empirical data analyses to assess the
               performance and bias of SCR with LESS. LESS produced unbiased
               estimates of SCR parameters when the AC window width was
               $\geq$5$\sigma$ ($\sigma$: the scale parameter of the
               half-normal detection function), and when the detector window
               extended beyond the edge of the AC window by 2$\sigma$.
               Importantly, LESS considerably decreased the computation time
               needed for fitting SCR models. In our simulations, LESS
               increased the computation speed of SCR models up to 57-fold. We
               demonstrate the power of this new approach by mapping the
               density of an elusive large carnivore-the wolverine (Gulo
               gulo)-with an unprecedented resolution and across the species'
               entire range in Norway (> 200,000 km2). Our approach helps
               overcome a major computational obstacle to population and
               landscape-level SCR analyses. The LESS implementation in a
               Bayesian framework makes the customization and fitting of SCR

  abstract  = "This work develops and estimates a three-factor term structure
               model with explicit sentiment factors in a period including the
               global financial crisis, where market confidence was said to
               erode considerably. It utilizes a large text data of real time,
               relatively high-frequency market news and takes account of the
               difficulties in incorporating market sentiment into the models.
               To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use
               this category of data in term-structure models. Although market
               sentiment or market confidence is often regarded as an important
               driver of asset markets, it is not explicitly incorporated in
               traditional empirical factor models for daily yield curve data
               because they are unobservable. To overcome this problem, we use
               a text mining approach to generate observable variables which
               are driven by otherwise unobservable sentiment factors. Then,
               applying the Monte Carlo filter as a filtering method in a state
               space Bayesian filtering approach, we estimate the dynamic
               stochastic structure of these latent factors from observable
               variables driven by these latent variables. As a result, the
               three-factor model with text mining is able to distinguish (1) a
               spread-steepening factor which is driven by pessimists' view and
               explaining the spreads related to ultra-long term yields from
               (2) a spread-flattening factor which is driven by optimists'
               view and influencing the long and medium term spreads. Also, the
               three-factor model with text mining has better fitting to the
               observed yields than the model without text mining. Moreover, we
               collect market participants' views about specific spreads in the
               term structure and find that the movement of the identified
               sentiment factors are consistent with the market participants'
               views, and thus market sentiment.",

  abstract  = "In the past several years, the liberalization of the electricity
               supply, the increase in variability of electric appliances and
               their use, and the need to respond to the electricity demand in
               real time has made electricity demand forecasting a challenge.
               To this challenge, many solutions are being proposed. The
               electricity demand involves many sources such as economic
               activities, household need and weather sources. All of these
               sources make electricity demand forecasting difficult. To
               forecast the electricity demand, some proposed parametric
               methods that integrate main variables that are sources of
               electricity demand. Others proposed a non parametric method such
               as pattern recognition methods. In this paper, we propose to
               take only the past electricity consumption information embedded
               in a functional vector autoregressive state space model to
               forecast the future electricity demand. The model we proposed
               aims to be applied at some aggregation level between regional
               and nation-wide grids. To estimate the parameters of this model,
               we use likelihood maximization, spline smoothing, functional
               principal components analysis and Kalman filtering. Through
               numerical experiments on real datasets, both from supplier
               Enercoop and from the Transmission System Operator of the French
               nation-wide grid, we show the appropriateness of the approach.",
