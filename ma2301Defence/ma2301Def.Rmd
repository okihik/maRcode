# Introduction
## Introduction
<!-- World -->
- One-third of food is lost or wasted around the world[1].

<!-- Canada -->
- Around 1.3 billion tons of FWL is generated annually, and the rate is projected to grow by 44% per year by 2025[2].
- Canada creates about 35 million tons and the largest waste generator per capita in western countries in 2016[3].

<!-- BC -->
- In BC, 40% of the waste to landfills is organic waste, the majority is produced from domestic waste[4].

<!-- PG -->


<!-- Domestic Studies -->


<!-- Food Service -->
- Limited number of studies have been conducted on the food supply side


## Introduction
### Research Questions

- What is the average volume of food that is wasted during processing and consumption in restaurants?
- What is the extent of food wastage in Japanese restaurants in Prince George?
- What are the main factors contributing to food loss and waste?
- To what extent is a social or environmental impact from food loss waste generated by a
single restaurant?
- What approaches are Japanese restaurant operators taking to reduce food waste generation?

# Literature Review
## Literature Review
### Definition of FLW
- No universally accepted definitions of FLW

| Organizations | Definition |
|---            |---         |
|Food Loss by FAO | harvest/slaughter/catch | retail/ consumption |
|Food Waste by FAO | retail/ consumption |
|Food Waste by EU | Food removed from FSC |
|Food Loss by US | unused product from agri |
|Food Waste by US | Subcomponent of FL |


## Literature Review
### Five Measurements of FLW

| Method | Note |
|---     |---   |
|1.Self-report | individuals report FLW |
|              | low cost but high dropouts |
|2.Survey | collect FLW by interview or questionnaire |
|         | cost-effective but not accurate |
|3.Composition | sample and analysis at lab |
|              | need special knowledge and equipment |
|4.Mass balance | material flow analysis |
|               | limitation in waste factor assumptions |
|5.Direct weight | directly measure FLW |
|                | most accurate but high cost |

## Literature Review
### Statistic Model
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Ad: Simple and interpretable
- Disad: Not suitable to time series 
- Disad: Stationary and Spurious

- **Bayesian Modelling**
- Ad: Flexible and adaptable to time series data
- Disad: No appropriate result in some cases

## Literature Review
### Effects of Food Loss and Waste

- **Economic Loss**:
- labour, material resources, time, and energy
- **Environmental Impacts**:
- water scarcity, soil erosion, and GHG

## Literature Review
### Hypotheses

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3


# Methods
## Methods
### Study Area
- Japanese restaurant in Prince George
- open for lunch and dinner for three hours each, six days of a week

## Methods
### Sample Collection
![Busket](busket.jpg){width=40%}
![Busket and Strainer](busketStrainer.jpg){width=45%}

## Methods
### Sample Size
- By Power analysis, 95% CI and 10% margin of error with most conservative estimate says 97 samples[]
- one in ten rule (rule-of-thumb) suggests 100 observations with 10 predictors[]
- Green's rule states 130 samples with 10 predictors[] 

## Methods
### Variables
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

### Model
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3
